# Why, hello there!

Welcome to KWoC '17. A lot has already been said and written about why participating in KWoC is already a great step in your path to Open Source Development. In this document, I'll try to list below everything I plan to cover **with your help** as part of KWoC '17.

## Project scope
The goal of this project would be to create an API for all things KGP. This could mean that you will be building endpoints that can be queried to find about departments, professors, subjects or maybe to verify students or to get information about places to eat. The possibilies are many.

## Technical know-how
There are no prerequisites per se. You'll be learning about RESTful APIs & related methods, writing APIs (and best practices), representing data in databases, testing and deployment. The language is yet to be decided, but will most certainly be Python in favour of higher productivity and ease of understanding.

## Roadmap for KWoC
- Define the schema for storing data in the database
- Write GET endpoints to fetch a lit of all departments, professors and research areas. (Maybe merge MCMP?)
- Write a POST endpoint to authenticate a student using ERP
- Write tests for the API
- Deploy the API

## About me
I am Naresh, 5th year dual degree student, department of Computer Science, IITKGP. Most of my work has been in Javascript, Python and C++ and would be glad to guide you wherever needed, hoping you'll put in just as much effort.

## Still interested?
Great! Reach out to me through email (ghostwriternr@gmail.com) or via Slack (https://slack.metakgp.org/). I try to reply as soon as possible.

Happy coding!
